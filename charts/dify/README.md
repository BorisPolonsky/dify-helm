# dify-helm
Deploy [langgenius/dify](https://github.com/langgenius/dify), an LLM-based chatbot app on Kubernetes with Helm chart.
## Quick Start
```bash
# Add the Helm repository
helm repo add dify https://borispolonsky.github.io/dify-helm
helm repo update
helm install my-release dify/dify
```

## Customized Installation
Apply the `-f` option upon `helm install`/`helm upgrade` with your own `values.yaml`.
Fear not its extensive content as it is arranged in sections below:
1. Image: Adjust images of all Dify components
2. Dify Service: Customize configurations of each Dify component
3. Middleware: Specifies the configuration of built-in middlewares
4. External services: Substitute external services for built-in data persistence
 
### 1. Use Alternative Images
You can specify custom images for different components:
```yaml
# values.yaml
image:
  api:
    repository: your-registry/dify-api
    tag: "your-tag"
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  web:
    repository: your-registry/dify-web
    tag: "your-tag"
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  sandbox:
    repository: your-registry/dify-sandbox
    tag: "your-tag"
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  proxy:
    repository: your-registry/nginx
    tag: "your-tag"
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  ssrfProxy:
    repository: your-registry/squid
    tag: "your-tag"
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  pluginDaemon:
    repository: your-registry/dify-plugin-daemon
    tag: "your-tag"
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

### 2. Customize Dify Components
#### Data persistence
To customize built-in data persistence, set `enabled: true` in the `persistence` section of `values.yaml` and specify the storage class and size, for instance:
```yaml
# values.yaml
api:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    storageClass: your-storage-class
    accessMode: ReadWriteMany
    size: 10Gi

```
or designate an existing `PersistentVolumeClaim`:
```yaml
# values.yaml
api:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      existingClaim: "your-pvc-name"
```
#### Environment Variables
This chart automatically manages environment variables for data persistence, service discovery and database connection etc. under the hood. To apply additional environment variables or override existing ones, refer to `extraEnv` section for each component:
```yaml
# values.yaml
...
api:
  extraEnv:
  # Direct value assignment
  - name: LANG
    value: "C.UTF-8"
  # Use existing configmaps
  - name: MY_CONFIG
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: my-config
        key: MY_CONFIG
  # Use existing secrets
  - name: MY_SECRET
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: my-secret
        key: MY_SECRET
```

### 3. Working with Built-in Middlewares
For a quickstart, the chart features built-in `Redis`, `PostgreSQL` and `Weaviate` that powers a self-contained `Dify` environment. These components are supplied by third-party Helm charts and enabled by default. To customize their settings, refer to the section name and the official documents:

| Section | Document |
----- | --- |
`redis` | [bitnami/redis](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis)
`postgresql` |[bitnami/postgresql](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql)
`weaviate`| [weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-helm)

*Note: These components may not keep up to the versions in Dify's `docker-compose.yml`. For more advanced, production-oriented setups, you may opt in external services instead. Refer to the next section for more details.

### 4. Opt in External Services
It's advised to use Redis, PostgreSQL and Weaviate from external providers over the built-in middlewares for production use regarding:
- enterprise-level maintainability,
- managing Redis and PostgreSQL independently of the Dify release,
- applying different upgrade cycles, and
- utilizing advanced configurations that are not available in the subcharts.

To opt in `Redis` from external providers for instance:
```yaml
# values.yaml
redis:
  enabled: false  # Disable built-in Redis

externalRedis:
  enabled: true
  host: "redis.example"
  port: 6379
  username: ""
  password: "difyai123456"
  useSSL: false
```
Refer to `external<Service>` sections in `values.yaml` for each component to be used.

## Advanced Topics
### Migrate Built-in Redis and PostgreSQL instances as Separate Releases
#### Intro
To migrate built-in Redis and PostgreSQL as separate releases within the same cluster while preserving existing data, refer to the following sections:

#### Prerequisite
This guide assumes the replication architecture of built-in Redis and PostgreSQL (the default configuration). For setups like Redis in Sentinel mode, user would have to come up with their own solutions.

Add the Bitnami Helm repository:
```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
```

Set the following environment variables according to your deployment:

```bash
export RELEASE_NAME="your-release-name"    # Helm release name (e.g., 'my-dify' from 'helm install my-dify dify/dify')
export NAMESPACE="your-namespace"          # Deployment namespace
export CHART_VERSION=$(helm list -n $NAMESPACE | grep $RELEASE_NAME | awk '{print $9}')  # Chart version of dify-helm
```

#### Backup Configuration and Data

```bash
# Backup your current values
helm get values $RELEASE_NAME -n $NAMESPACE > dify-backup-values.yaml

# Backup ConfigMaps and Secrets (Recommended)
# If authentication data is out of sync with Redis/PostgreSQL ConfigMaps and Secrets, use your own backup solution.
kubectl get configmap -n $NAMESPACE -o yaml > dify-configmaps-backup.yaml
kubectl get secret -n $NAMESPACE -o yaml > dify-secrets-backup.yaml

# Optionally backup PVC data (depends on your backup solution)
# This step is recommended but optional depending on your backup strategy
```

**Important**: Back up ConfigMaps and Secrets, especially when randomly generated passwords were used (e.g., the default behavior of built-in PostgreSQL replica setups) as they won't persist after migration.

#### Update Redis and PostgreSQL Configurations
First, identify the existing PVCs that are used by the built-in databases:

```bash
kubectl get pvc -n $NAMESPACE
```

For example:
- Redis: `redis-data-my-release-redis-master-0`, `redis-data-my-release-redis-replicas-0`, etc.
- PostgreSQL: `data-my-release-postgresql-primary-0`, `data-my-release-postgresql-read-0`

Next, create `redis-values.yaml` and `postgresql-values.yaml` that inherit the original settings and modify `<role>.persistence.existingClaim` or `fullnameOverride` to re-use existing PVCs.

For Redis:

For single master setup (default)
```yaml
# redis-values.yaml
# Inherit all original settings from your backup, modify existingClaim to re-use the previously created PVCs
master:
  count: 1
  persistence:
    existingClaim: "redis-data-my-release-redis-master-0"  # Applies only if only 1 master is configured.
replica:
  replicaCount: 3
  persistence:
    existingClaim: ""  # Replicas will sync data from master
```
Or use the following approach as altnernative:

```yaml
# redis-values.yaml
## @param fullnameOverride String to fully override common.names.fullname
##
fullnameOverride: "my-release-redis" # ${RELEASE_NAME}-redis
```

For PostgreSQL:

```yaml
# postgresql-values.yaml
# Inherit all original settings from your backup, modify existingClaims to re-use the previously created PVCs
primary:
  persistence:
    existingClaim: "data-my-release-postgresql-primary-0"
  
readReplicas:
  replicaCount: 1
  persistence:
    existingClaim: "data-my-release-postgresql-read-0"  # Applies only if only 1 read replica is configured. Leave it empty if more than 1 read replica is configured.
```

**Note**: When reusing existing PVCs, the configured password in the new release will be ignored as the database retains the password from the original installation. Store your credentials in a secure vault rather than relying on the Secret created in the new release.

#### Disable built-in Redis and PostgreSQL
Before shutting down built-in databases, confirm that the PVCs for `Redis` and `PostgreSQL` will persist (e.g., via the `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` annotation) after the uninstallation process. You may also check the reclaim policy of PVs if applicable (e.g. Use `Retain` to prevent data loss in case the bound PVCs were deleted upon migration, which would end up deleting the PV itself if the policy were `Delete`).
Shutdown the built-in databases to ensure no processes are accessing the PVCs:

Disable built-in databases by setting `redis.enabled=false` and `postgresql=false` based on your original `values.yaml`:
```bash

helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME dify/dify -n $NAMESPACE \
  --version $CHART_VERSION \
  -f values-with-redis-and-pg-disabled.yaml
```

Wait until Redis and PostgreSQL pods terminate:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE -w
```

#### Deploy Redis and PostgreSQL with exisiting PVCs
Once the built-in databases are fully shut down, re-deploy Redis and PostgreSQL as separate releases:

```bash
# Install standalone Redis
helm install my-redis bitnami/redis \
  --version 16.13.2 \
  -n $NAMESPACE \
  -f redis-values.yaml

# Install standalone PostgreSQL  
helm install my-postgresql bitnami/postgresql \
  --version 12.5.6 \
  -n $NAMESPACE \
  -f postgresql-values.yaml
```

Verify that pods are running correctly:

```bash
# Check Redis pods
kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE | grep my-redis

# Check PostgreSQL pods
kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE | grep my-postgresql

# Test connectivity if needed
```

#### Update Dify Configuration
Update your Dify release regarding external Redis and PostgreSQL:

```yaml
# dify-external-db-values.yaml
redis:
  enabled: false

postgresql:
  enabled: false

externalRedis:
  enabled: true
  host: "my-redis-master"  # Service name of the new Redis deployment
  port: 6379
  password: "difyai123456"  # Use the same password as your previous deployment

externalPostgres:
  enabled: true
  username: "postgres"
  password: "difyai123456"  # Use the same password as your previous deployment
  address: "my-postgresql"  # Service name of the new PostgreSQL deployment
  port: 5432
  database:
    api: "dify"
    pluginDaemon: "dify_plugin"
```

```bash
helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME dify/dify -n $NAMESPACE -f dify-external-db-values.yaml
```

#### Important Notes
- Make sure to use the same passwords and usernames for the standalone deployments as were used in the built-in versions to avoid authentication issues.
- Always backup your data before performing this migration.
- Test this process in a non-production environment first to ensure you understand the steps and potential issues.

### Migrate from Built-in Weaviate as Separate Release
#### Prerequisite
This guide assumes the default configuration of built-in Weaviate.

Add the Weaviate Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add weaviate https://weaviate.github.io/weaviate-helm
helm repo update
```

Set the following environment variables according to your deployment:

```bash
export RELEASE_NAME="your-release-name"    # Helm release name (e.g., 'my-dify' from 'helm install my-dify dify/dify')
export NAMESPACE="your-namespace"          # Deployment namespace
export CHART_VERSION=$(helm list -n $NAMESPACE | grep $RELEASE_NAME | awk '{print $9}')  # Chart version of dify-helm
export WEAVIATE_CHART_VERSION="16.1.0"     # Check the Chart.yaml for the exact version of the Weaviate Helm chart
```

#### Backup Authentication Info of Weaviate
```bash
# Backup your current values
helm get values $RELEASE_NAME -n $NAMESPACE > dify-backup-values.yaml

# Backup ConfigMaps and Secrets (Recommended)
kubectl get configmap -n $NAMESPACE -o yaml > dify-configmaps-backup.yaml
kubectl get secret -n $NAMESPACE -o yaml > dify-secrets-backup.yaml
```

**Note**: Backing up ConfigMaps and Secrets is optional but recommended to avoid losing your original authentication configurations.

#### Re-deploy Weaviate as a Separate Release
Shutdown the built-in Weaviate to ensure no processes are accessing the PVCs to avoid data corruption. Set `weaviate.enabled=false`, then

```bash
helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME dify/dify -n $NAMESPACE \
  --version $CHART_VERSION \
  -f values-with-weaviate-disabled.yaml
```

Wait until Weaviate pods to terminate:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE -w
```

Extract the whole `.Values.weaviate` section and save as `weaviate-values.yaml` to keep your current configurations. The `.Values.weavaiate` should be un-nested as `.Values`. Re-deploy Weaviate with the following command:

```bash
# Install standalone Weaviate
helm install my-weaviate weaviate/weaviate \
  --version $WEAVIATE_CHART_VERSION \
  -n $NAMESPACE \
  -f weaviate-values.yaml
```

Verify that Weaviate is running correctly:

```bash
# Check Weaviate pods
kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE | grep weaviate
# Test connectivity if needed
```

#### Update Dify Service
Update Dify configurartions to use external Weaviate service instead of the built-in one:

```yaml
# dify-external-weaviate-values.yaml
weaviate:
  enabled: false

externalWeaviate:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: "http://weaviate:80"  # Service name from `kubectl get svc -n $NAMESPACE | grep weaviate`
  apiKey: "your-api-key" # The first key in the original `.Values.weaviate.authentication.apikey.allowed_keys` by default
```

```bash
helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME dify/dify -n $NAMESPACE -f dify-external-weaviate-values.yaml
```

### ExternalSecret Support

#### Background

In Kubernetes production environments, storing sensitive information (such as database passwords, API keys, etc.) directly in values.yaml is insecure. ExternalSecret addresses this issue through the [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/), which can securely retrieve sensitive information from external secret management systems (such as AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, etc.) and automatically create Kubernetes Secret resources.

Why ExternalSecret is needed:

- **Security**: Avoid storing plain text passwords in Git repositories or configuration files
- **Centralized Management**: Unified management of all sensitive information
- **Automatic Rotation**: Support for automatic key updates and rotation
- **Compliance**: Meet enterprise security and compliance requirements

#### Currently Supported External Components

When ExternalSecret is enabled, sensitive information for the following components can be retrieved from external secret stores:

##### Database Connections

- **PostgreSQL**: Database username, password
- **Redis**: Authentication password, username
- **Elasticsearch**: Username, password

##### Object Storage

- **AWS S3**: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key

##### Vector Databases

- **ElasticSearch**: Username, Password

##### Email Services

- **Resend**: API Key, sender email
- **SendGrid**: API Key, sender email

##### Other Services

- **Code Execution Service**: API Key
- **Plugin System**: Daemon Key, internal API Key
- **Application Core**: Secret Key

Usage: Set `externalSecret.enabled: true` in values.yaml and configure the corresponding secretStore and remoteRefs parameters.
